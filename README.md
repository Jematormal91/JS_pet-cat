# VIRTUAL PET CAT

**Create an object that represents a cat.** </br>
It should have properties for tiredness, hunger, loneliness, and happiness </br>

Next, write methods that increase and decrease those properties. </br>
Call them something that actually represents what would increase or decrease these things, like "feed", "sleep", or "pet". </br>

Last, write a method that prints out the cat's status in each area. </br>
*(Be creative e.g. Paws is really hungry, Paws is VERY happy.)* </br>
